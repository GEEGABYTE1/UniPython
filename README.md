# UniPython 

A Program to interact with UniSwap protocols locally. 

Commands include viewing conversion/rates, selling, buying, adding/removing liqudity and adding pool rates.

# First Steps

The program will prompt the user to manually type in their account address and private key of their Ethereum Wallet. This can be either on MetaMask or some other platform, but it is necessary to type it in correctly as the terminal will not be able to call the MetaMask client. 

Users can choose versions ranging from `1 - 3`. UniSwap versions 1 and 3 have different selling and buying methods, where pool fees are taken into consideration, liquidity, and pooling methods are present. It should be noted that the base version that the program runs on by default is `2` for stability, but the user can choose another version if needed.
